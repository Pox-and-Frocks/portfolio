## About Me

### Your Favourite Historian's Favourite Historian

![Cats!](/assets/img/cats.png)

More than ten years of experience spelunking in museum and archival collections, too many spreadsheets to count, and a level of determination to solve historical mysteries that is frankly a tad ridiculous.

Ready to help you untangle the snarls in whatever research you're about to embark upon.

You should send me some info to write about yourself. Like a paragraph that summarizes what you do. You can steal it from the cover letter you wrote idk. I believe in you. Also the image here is cats but should be you I think. Cats can be moved.
