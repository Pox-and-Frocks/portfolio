## About Me

### Your Favourite Historian's Favourite Historian

![Me, Hanna](/assets/img/bio.jpg)

More than ten years of experience spelunking in museum and archival collections, too many spreadsheets to count, and a level of determination to solve historical mysteries that is frankly a tad ridiculous.

Ready to help you untangle the snarls in whatever research you're about to embark upon.
